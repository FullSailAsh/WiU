   				<p>"Dance is the hidden language of the soul" Martha Graham <br> With a long standing, meaningful history, <strong>dance</strong> is the manner in which a person rhythmically moves their body.  It can be considered a form of art, exercise, a way of communication or even as a therapeutic avenue (and in many instances all of the above).  Whether it is done with or without music, it is a language of the body that is spoken with many dialects world wide. </p>

				<h2 id="styles">Styles of Dance</h2>
				<p>With <em>countless</em> styles of dance in existence, there
				are three significant categories that are considered, in order to determine a genre or style of dance:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Whether or not it is choreographed</li>
					<li>The movements used in the dance</li>
					<li>The era and geographical location where the style of dance began.</li>

				<h2 id="prof">Dance as a Profession</h2>
			
				<p>While a lot of dance is done for enjoyment, there are
				many ways that dance can be turned into a profession.</p>
			
			
					<h3>As a Dancer</h3>
						<p>The most common profession in the industry is a
					professional dancer.  With varying degrees of professionalism, the
					possibilities for a dancer as an entertainer are ever-changing, and
					often low-paying.  Those who make a career by dancing often are a part of a union, such as the <abbr title="American Guild of Musical
					Artists">AGMA</abbr>, the <abbr title="Screen Actors Guild">SAG</abbr>, and the <abbr title="Actors' Equity Association">AEA</abbr>. </p>
					
			
			
			
					<h3>As a Dance Teacher</h3>
					<p> Often retired dancers, or just those who love to pass
					the passion and technique of learning dance on to others, dance teachers are the core of a great portion of the dance community.  While some dancers are self taught, many grow up taking lessons and classes, often culminating in performances and recitals, which helps them build on their craft.  At the root of this are dance teachers, who take on the, again, low-paying job of helping to form future dancers. </p>
					
			
			
			
					<h3>As a Choreographer</h3>
						<p>A choreographer is anyone who creates a dance.  While there are many hobbyists, there are also professionals who make it their career.  Choreographers can create dances for a range of events, a recital, broadway play, music entertainers--the list is of opportunities is endless.</p>
						
			
		
			
					<h3>As a Dance and Movement Therapist</h3>
					<p>Dance and movement therapy (DMT) is a growing field.  Recognizing the therapeutic release that dance can have for a person, <abbr title="dance and movement therapy">DMT</abbr> therapists use movement and dance in their sessions to help make cognitive behavior progress in a client's well-being.</p>
